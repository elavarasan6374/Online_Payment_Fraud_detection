# Online_Payment_Fraud_detection
The online payment fraud detection system's code In order to improve the security of financial transactions and avert any losses, the initiative seeks to identify fraudulent activities in online payments. The technology employs machine learning algorithms to evaluate diverse attributes linked to transactions, enabling the differentiation of authentic and fraudulent activity.

#Dataset: The research makes use of an extensive online payment dataset that includes details about balances, transaction types, amounts, and other relevant information.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): To comprehend feature distribution, find patterns, and pinpoint possible relationships, a great deal of EDA has been done. The data is preprocessed using visualizations, statistical summaries, and data cleaning methods.

Machine Learning Models: The project's core is the use of machine learning techniques to detect fraud. We apply and contrast the following algorithms:

1.Strong ensemble learning technique Random Forest is renowned for its capacity to manage complicated datasets and reduce overfitting.
2.XGBoost: A powerful gradient boosting technique that is particularly good at identifying complex patterns in data.
3.K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A straightforward but efficient method that groups data points according to how close they are to one another.
4.One linear model that is frequently used as a starting point for binary classification tasks is logistic regression.
